# Use the pcap-file capture method (Suricata will pick it when you pass -r).
pcap-file:
  checksum-checks: auto
  # (capture method options live here; --pcap-file-continuous is a CLI flag)

# Output only what you need; EVE JSON to a single file
outputs:
  - eve-log:
      enabled: yes
      filetype: regular
      filename: /var/log/suricata/eve.json
      # For high-speed parsing, let threads write to their own files:
      # thread: true   # (creates eve.<id>.json files)
      types:
        - flow        # flow summaries
        - alert       # signature hits (if you enable detection/rules)
        - stats       # optional, handy for performance

# Optional: disable detection if you only want flow summaries first
# detection:
#   enabled: no

# If you plan to use rules, make sure your rules dir is mounted:
# default-rule-path: /etc/suricata/rules
# rule-files:
#   - suricata.rules
